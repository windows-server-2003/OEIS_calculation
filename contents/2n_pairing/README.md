# Number of pairing of 1...2n such that the {sum|absolute difference} of each pair is different
Inclusion-exclusion on the subset of $[1, 2n]$ which the pairing can use.

A320129 - distinct sums
A060963 - distinct absolute differences

Work-in-progress. Probably able to port to GPU for massive speedup?

memo: A322178 is related?
