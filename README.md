This is a collection of code to compute more terms of some of the sequences on OEIS.


### Ongoing projects
| Content                   | Status                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Number of independent sets on $n \times m$ grid graph | Computation ongoing for $n \le 55, m \le 200$. Expected to complete in June 2026 |
| Number of independent sets on $n \times m$ toroidal grid graph  | Primary computation completed for $n \le 35, m \le 100$. Implementing verification program |
